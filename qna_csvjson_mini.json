    "Question": "What are the major factors contributing to the change in Apple's gross margin in the most recent 10-Q compared to the previous quarters?",
    "Source Docs": "*AAPL*",
    "Question Type": "Multi-Doc RAG",
    "Source Chunk Type": "Text",
    "Answer": "In the most recent 10-Q for the quarter ended July 1, 2023, the factors contributing to the change in Apple's gross margin compared to previous quarters include:\n\n1. Weakness in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which had an unfavorable impact on gross margin.\n2. Lower Products volume, which decreased gross margin.\n3. Cost savings and a different Products mix, which partially offset the decrease in gross margin.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2023, the Products gross margin percentage increased compared to the same quarter in 2022 due to cost savings and a different Products mix, despite the negative impact of foreign currency weakness and decreased leverage. However, the year-over-year Products gross margin percentage for the first nine months of 2023 decreased due to the weakness in foreign currencies and decreased leverage, despite cost savings and a different Products mix.\n\nThe Services gross margin increased due to higher Services net sales but was partially offset by the weakness in foreign currencies and higher Services costs. The Services gross margin percentage decreased due to higher Services costs, partially offset by improved leverage.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2023 Q3 AAPL.pdf"

    "Question": "Has there been any significant change in Apple's operating expenses over the reported quarters? If so, what are the key drivers for this change?",

    "Question Type": "Multi-Doc RAG",
    "Source Chunk Type": "Table",
    "Answer": "Yes, there has been a change in Apple's operating expenses over the reported quarters. The key drivers for this change are increases in research and development (\"R&D\") expense and selling, general and administrative expense. The growth in R&D expense is primarily driven by increases in headcount-related expenses.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2022, the total operating expenses were $12,809 million, with R&D expenses of $6,797 million and selling, general and administrative expenses of $6,012 million.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2023, the total operating expenses increased to $14,316 million, with R&D expenses of $7,709 million and selling, general and administrative expenses of $6,607 million.\n\nFor the second quarter of 2023, the total operating expenses were $13,658 million, with R&D expenses of $7,457 million and selling, general and administrative expenses of $6,201 million.\n\nFor the third quarter of 2023, the total operating expenses were $13,415 million, with R&D expenses of $7,442 million and selling, general and administrative expenses of $5,973 million.\n\nThe consistent increase in R&D expenses indicates the company's continued investment in innovation and product development. The selling, general and administrative expenses have also increased, although they saw a slight decrease in the third quarter of 2023 compared to the second quarter of 2023.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2022 Q3 AAPL.pdf, 2023 Q1 AAPL.pdf, 2023 Q2 AAPL.pdf, 2023 Q3 AAPL.pdf"

    "Source Docs": "*2023 Q3 INTC*",
    "Question Type": "Single-Doc Multi-Chunk RAG",
    "Source Chunk Type": "Table",
    "Answer": "Intel's effective tax rate for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023, was 696.2%, and for the nine months ended September 30, 2023, it was 642.0%. This information is found in Note 7: Income Taxes, which states that the provision for (benefit from) taxes was $(362) million on income (loss) before taxes of $(52) million for the third quarter, and $(1,041) million on income (loss) before taxes of $(2,026) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.\n\nThe notes section further explains that the provision for, or benefit from, income taxes for an interim period is typically determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate, adjusted for discrete items. However, for the first nine months of 2023, Intel used the actual effective tax rate for the year-to-date period because they were unable to make a reliable estimate of the annual effective tax rate due to the variability of the rate as a result of fluctuations in forecasted income and the effects of being taxed in multiple tax jurisdictions.\n\nSOURCE(S): 2023 Q3 INTC.pdf"
